Introduction
At Luul Solutions, we specialize in providing cloud consultancy services to help businesses transition to the cloud seamlessly. Recently, I undertook a project for a client whose SAP workloads were running in a corporate data center.

This environment was divided into three distinct layers: Production, Quality Assurance (QA), and Development/Test.

My mission as a Cloud Architect was to estimate the costs associated with migrating this infrastructure to AWS, with the understanding that it would operate in the cloud for at least the next three years.

The Scenario
The clientâ€™s SAP landscape was critical to their operations, and migrating to AWS promised enhanced scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. However, a thorough cost estimation was essential to ensure that the migration would be financially viable.

The Challenge:

During the migration process, many organizations face the daunting task of accurately estimating cloud costs. In this case, the client was at risk of underestimating their expenses, which could lead to budget overruns and financial strain.


ðŸ’¡ The Solution:

To tackle this challenge, I implemented a comprehensive cost estimation strategy using the AWS Pricing Calculator. Hereâ€™s how I approached it:

1. Detailed Cost Analysis: I meticulously estimated costs for all required services, including EC2 instances, EBS storage, load balancers, and Oracle databases, ensuring no stone was left unturned.
2. Inclusion of All Factors: I accounted for direct costs and additional factors like data transfer fees and backup storage, providing a holistic view of the financial landscape.
3. Cost Management Strategy: I established a budget and utilized AWS Cost Explorer to monitor expenses, setting alerts to prevent budget overruns.
4. Savings Plans: I recommended leveraging Compute Savings Plans to optimize costs for predictable workloads, leading to significant long-term savings.
5. Proof of Concept (PoC): Before full migration, I conducted a PoC for critical workloads, allowing us to fine-tune our approach and avoid potential pitfalls.
6. Expert Consultation: Engaging with AWS experts ensured that we followed best practices for cost optimization and architectural efficiency.

ðŸ“Š Presenting the Results:

I created an executive-ready PowerPoint presentation to communicate the findings effectively, complete with visualizations and clear explanations of cost drivers.
